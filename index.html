        <h2>Answer #1</h2>
        <p>Create a Tip calcuator function that takes in three things:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>meal price</li>
          <li>Tax Rate</li>
          <li>Tip Rate</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It should return a value which you can console.log. Have the function default to 13% tax and 15% tip. Make the function return a string formatted $x.xx. (please use ES6 for this!)</p>

        <h2>Answer #2</h2>
        <p>Create a student object. The student should have the following properties:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>equipment (array with computer, pen, paper strings inside of it).</li>
          <li>energy (number - 300).</li>
          <li>grades (number - 95).</li>
          <li>uniform (object with top, bottoms, shoes properties).</li>
          <li>create a method that takes in food (number of calories) and then updates energy by the same number of calories.</li>
          <li>create a method that takes in new equipment that will update our equipment array (add it to the end).</li>
          <li>create a method that will change any part of the uniform object (since everyday you wear something different).</li>
          <li>create a method study time that takes time studied (minutes) that will update our grades and deplete our energy. </li>
          <li>For every hour that you study, your grades go up by 5% (example: if your grade is 60, and you study an hour, your grade will be 65). For every hour you study, your energy goes down by 2. (Bonus: if your energy goes below 0, your grades go down 10%)</li>
          <li>Update uniform method to change something that doesn't exist in the uniform object, like adding an accessory, that is equal to glasses.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Please iterate through the farm object below.</p> 
        <p>If there is a nested object, then iterate through that as well.</p> 
        <p>You should console log each property name and property value in all objects, 
        example "crop is Winter Wheat", using a template literal.</p>
